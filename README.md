# Flight Customer Satisfaction Prediction

## Overview

This project aims to predict airline passenger satisfaction using machine learning techniques. By analyzing various factors related to flight experiences, the model determines whether a passenger is likely to be satisfied or not. This analysis can help airlines enhance their services and improve customer experiences.

## Problem Statement

Airlines seek to understand the key factors influencing passenger satisfaction to improve service quality and customer retention. This project addresses the challenge by building a predictive model based on passenger data.

## Dataset

The dataset includes information on passengers' demographics, flight details, and service ratings. Key features include:

- Gender  
- Age  
- Customer Type (e.g., Loyal, Disloyal)  
- Type of Travel (Business, Personal)  
- Class (Economy, Business, etc.)  
- Flight Distance  
- Departure and Arrival Delays  
- In-flight Services (e.g., Wi-Fi, Entertainment)  
- Onboard Services (e.g., Food, Cleanliness)  
- Overall Satisfaction  

## Approach

- **Data Preprocessing**: Handled missing values, encoded categorical variables, and normalized numerical features.  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Identified patterns and correlations between features and satisfaction levels.  
- **Model Selection**: Evaluated Logistic Regression classification algorithm.  
- **Model Evaluation**: Assessed models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Results

The Logistic Regression model achieved the highest accuracy OF 78 to 80%, indicating its effectiveness in predicting passenger satisfaction based on the provided features.

## Technologies Used

- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Logistic Regression  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn
- HTML
- CSS
- JS
- Flask
